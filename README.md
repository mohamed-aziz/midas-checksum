## MIDAS checksum

This is an old project of mine, I was reversing the midas pro6 console firmware to figure out how the confirmation code was calculated, since the company doesn't support it anymore.

Please note that this script works for the PRO3, PRO6, PRO9, XL8 and DL2.

This just emulated using unicorn.
